# LEGv8-EmuH
For a university course. Binary emulator of a subset of ARMv8.

# Original README
To run:
java -jar ./legv8_emuH.jar <filepath> [heap size] [stack size]

File path is a relative or absolute path to a assembled LEGv8 (subset of ARM) binary. Heap and stack sizes are both in bytes, with defaults of 4096 and 512 bytes, respectively.

Program and Javadoc built in Eclipse. If manual building is required, the main file is legv8emuH.global.LegV8_EmuH.java.

Project will soon be available under the name "LEGv8-EmuH" at https://github.com/superguideguy (please ignore the cringy gamertag from when I was 13)
